# [Portfolio](https://aborondia.netlify.app/projects) - [Andrew Borondia](https://aborondia.netlify.app/projects)

This is a site I created entirely in **React.js** to house my portfolio. Originally created for the Software Developer program at the [Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology](https://mitt.ca/), I have since updated it in various ways, such as setting up a backend for easily updating content & otherwise cleaning up old code.
