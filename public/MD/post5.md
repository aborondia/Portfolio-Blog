# **Master Saga Frontier**
*6/4/2021*\
by [Andrew Borondia](/about-me)\
\
The remaster of the classic RPG **Saga Frontier** was just released a few weeks ago. In this guide I'm going to share with you various strategies I've learned to master the game. These strategies apply to both the original 1997 version, as well as the new remaster.

## **Pick strong allies**

Not all characters talents are equal. Some particular characters stand out from the others because of special abilities, and/or higher stat growth.

### **Asellus**

- The only character other than Blue/Rouge that has the gift of time magic, which is one of the most powerful schools of magic in the game.
- Grows JP stat quickly.

  _You can use the Stasis Rune spell instead of snake oil to obtain the effect. Although very well known, and referred to as a glitch, it was not removed from the remaster._

### **Mesarthim**

- Has the advantage over other mystics of not having mystic mail locked to their equipment slots.
- Provides excellent healing support with Mesarthim having access to life rain and Dr. Nusakan having access to mystic heal.
- Grows WP & JP quickly.

### **Kylin**

![Kylin](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/romancingsaga/images/7/71/IS_Kylin_Artwork.png)\
 _Kylin character art_\
 _Obtained from_ [_Saga Wiki_](https://saga.fandom.com/wiki/SaGa_Frontier)\
 [_Copyright Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com/)

- Has access to all the space magic spells.
- Has access to all abilities/forms that regular monsters do.
- Has a powerful starting form that can be effective up to the end game.

## **Plan your team**

The earlier you obtain the characters you wish to use for the end game, the longer you have to customize and grow their stats. There are a few important things to keep in mind:

* Use skills that a character has a talent for to raise corresponding stats; sword/fist increases strength & WP, magic increases will & JP, guns increase will & WP.
* Absorbing a monster that has not been absorbed before will permanently increase your monsters max HP by 5.
* Some enemies become unavailable later in the game so the earlier you start absorbing monsters with your own monster character, the higher their HP potential is.
* Once you obtain one rune (rune magic), or card (arcane magic), any character not present **will never be able to** obtain the corresponding gift, even if recruited before completing the quest.
* You cannot attempt to learn light/dark/mind magic more than once. Make sure you have all the characters you wish to learn that particular school in your party at the time you do the corresponding quest, and that they do not possess any magic from opposing schools.
* You can buy magic from an opposing school to discard unwanted spells.

Information was taken from [this recruitment guide](https://psnprofiles.com/guide/12278-saga-frontier-remastered-character-recruitment-guide) (original information credit to [Frission](https://steamah.com/go/?url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/KittenyKat)). See the guide for more detailed information.

## **Plan your build**

Make sure you know what role you want your character(s) to play in your team. If you are using a fighter/mage, or pure mage, make sure you plan the quests to obtain the corresponding magic school gifts you want them to learn, keeping in mind that (with the exception of Blue/Rouge) **you cannot possess spells of two opposing schools at the same time**. Refer to [the magic guide](https://saga.fandom.com/wiki/SaGa_Frontier_Magic) for more info.

If you are using a monster, plan which form and skills you want by end game and be constantly alert for enemies that will yield the correct skills. Some enemies will be hard/impossible to find once you progress too far in the game. Refer to [the monster guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/198537-saga-frontier/faqs/36630) for more info.

If you are using a mech, get rich, and equip them with the most powerful gear you can. The Merchants in Koorong sell the most powerful equipment that can be purchased.

## **Get rich**

It is easy to obtain infinite money once you have enough starting capital. If playing the 1997 version refer to [this guide](https://saga.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Ingot_Trick), as the process is slightly different. To obtain an unending cash flow, follow these steps:

1. Buy golden ingots for 500G from the merchant in the bar in Nelson.
2. Check the gold merchant in the building next to the Koorong port, and if the selling price is not greater than 500G, you must buy more ingots from the Nelson merchant.
3. Sell your ingots in Koorong until the price drops below 500G.
4. Return to the Nelson merchant and repeat the process as desired.

I recommend keeping 50 ingots in your inventory at all times, as it allows you to spend without worrying since you will always have the resources to repeat the process.

## **Get instant death skills**

Some of the most powerful enemies in the game, including some bosses, are susceptible to instant death/petrify skills. Some are more effective than others:

- Time Eclipse - The most effective petrification ability in the game. Can be learned by any human/mystic if your protagonist has access to Time Lord's castle. If playing as Blue/Rouge, only he can learn time magic, not his comrades.
- Death Touch - Extremely potent and will almost always kill an enemy that is not immune to death. Can be learned by any monster character.
- Death/Petrify Gaze - Not as effective as Time Eclipse and Death Touch, but still very potent. Can be learned by any monster character.
- Dead End - An instant death sword skill that is less effective than the other skills listed, but is generally easier to obtain and is useful to human characters that do not use magic.

## **Get posessed**

There are enemies in the game called "Living Sword". When low on health (damaged by about 700+ HP) they will attempt to possess one of your party members. If the character is human, it will cause an unequippable sword called "Glirandly" to be added to their equipment. For each sword the human is equipped with it will raise all stats by 10. This can add up to a massive boost to their stats. Keep in mind however, **stats raised this way will grow slower on that character**.

So you learned how to pick the best characters, how to build them, and all the important information you need to make the ultimate team. Now you are ready to confidently conquer the world of Saga Frontier.
