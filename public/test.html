            <strong>Master Saga Frontier</strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            <em>6/4/2021</em><br />by <a href="/about-me">Andrew Borondia</a
            ><br /><br />The remaster of the classic RPG
            <strong>Saga Frontier</strong> was just released a few weeks ago. In
            this guide I'm going to share with you various strategies I've
            learned to master the game. These strategies apply to both the
            original 1997 version, as well as the new remaster.

          <p>
            Not all characters talents are equal. Some particular characters
            stand out from the others because of special abilities, and/or
            higher stat growth.

          <p>
            The earlier you obtain the characters you wish to use for the end
            game, the longer you have to customize and grow their stats. There
            are a few important things to keep in mind:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use skills that a character has a talent for to raise
              corresponding stats; sword/fist increases strength &amp; WP, magic
              increases will &amp; JP, guns increase will &amp; WP.
            </li>
            <li>
              Absorbing a monster that has not been absorbed before will
              permanently increase your monsters max HP by 5.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some enemies become unavailable later in the game so the earlier
              you start absorbing monsters with your own monster character, the
              higher their HP potential is.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once you obtain one rune (rune magic), or card (arcane magic), any
              character not present
              <strong>will never be able to</strong> obtain the corresponding
              gift, even if recruited before completing the quest.
            </li>
            <li>
              You cannot attempt to learn light/dark/mind magic more than once.
              Make sure you have all the characters you wish to learn that
              particular school in your party at the time you do the
              corresponding quest, and that they do not possess any magic from
              opposing schools.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can buy magic from an opposing school to discard unwanted
              spells.

            you progress too far in the game. Refer to

            If you are using a mech, get rich, and equip them with the most

          <p>
            It is easy to obtain infinite money once you have enough starting
            capital. If playing the 1997 version refer to
            <a href="https://saga.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Ingot_Trick"
              >this guide</a
            >, as the process is slightly different. To obtain an unending cash
            flow, follow these steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Buy golden ingots for 500G from the merchant in the bar in Nelson.
            </li>
            <li>
              Check the gold merchant in the building next to the Koorong port,
              and if the selling price is not greater than 500G, you must buy
              more ingots from the Nelson merchant.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sell your ingots in Koorong until the price drops below 500G.
            </li>
            <li>
              Return to the Nelson merchant and repeat the process as desired.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I recommend keeping 50 ingots in your inventory at all times, as it
            allows you to spend without worrying since you will always have the
            resources to repeat the process.

            <strong>Get instant death skills</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Some of the most powerful enemies in the game, including some
            bosses, are susceptible to instant death/petrify skills. Some are
            more effective than others:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Time Eclipse - The most effective petrification ability in the
              game. Can be learned by any human/mystic if your protagonist has
              access to Time Lord's castle. If playing as Blue/Rouge, only he
              can learn time magic, not his comrades.
            </li>
            <li>
              Death Touch - Extremely potent and will almost always kill an
              enemy that is not immune to death. Can be learned by any monster
              character.
            </li>
            <li>
              Death/Petrify Gaze - Not as effective as Time Eclipse and Death
              Touch, but still very potent. Can be learned by any monster
              character.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dead End - An instant death sword skill that is less effective
              than the other skills listed, but is generally easier to obtain
              and is useful to human characters that do not use magic.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="-strong-get-posessed-strong-">

            <strong>Get posessed</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            There are enemies in the game called "Living Sword". When low on
            health (damaged by about 700+ HP) they will attempt to possess one
            of your party members. If the character is human, it will cause an
            unequippable sword called "Glirandly" to be added to their
            equipment. For each sword the human is equipped with it will raise
            all stats by 10. This can add up to a massive boost to their stats.
            Keep in mind however,
            <strong
              >stats raised this way will grow slower on that character</strong
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            So you learned how to pick the best characters, how to build them,
            and all the important information you need to make the ultimate
            team. Now you are ready to confidently conquer the world of Saga
            Frontier.
